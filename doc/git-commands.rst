Session 1: GIT Introduction
===========================

1. `git init` to initialize the git file.
2. `git add <file>` to add files to staging area.
3. `man git commit` or `git help commit` to search help about the commit
    command. You can replace the **commit** command with other commands.
4. `git status` (we all know it :P) shows the current status of the branch.
5. `got log`
